## Neural_Networks_using_Numpy



There are many Frameworks we can use to implement complex `Neural Nets`. But the basic understanding of 
how things are going in the background makes things much easier and also helps tuning the *hyerparameters*.

`NumPy` is a great package for computation and considering the fact that every framework ranging from `tensorflow` to `pytorch` uses `NumPy` in the background, getting hands on `Numpy` is great way to manipulate **tensors** in those frameworks.

So I started this series in which I'll code basic algorithms in just `NumPy`. 

I'm also writing blogs where I'll explain the codes. Have a look the article if you get stuck anywhere in between the codes.
