## Neural_Networks_using_Numpy

There are many Frameworks we can use to implement complex Neural Nets. But the basic understanding of 
how things are going in the background makes things much easier and also helps tuning the hyerparameters.

So I started this series in which I'll code basic algorithms in just NumPy. NumPy is a great package for computing and 
considering the fact that every framework ranging from tensorflow to pytorch uses NumPy in the most fundamental 
level for computing, getting hands on Numpy is great way to manipulate tensors in those frameworks.
